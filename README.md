* HOW TO USE: *

    For running pre-written tests, execute in terminal:

        - java TestAlgorithms

    Values can be added / altered within the config.properties file.

* REPEATABILITY: *

    Each test is ran 5 times (with exceptions mentioned in test class), and an average is taken from all 5 runs.

* ADDING TEST METHODS *

    In order to add a test case to the algorithms, the following must be completed:

        1. In config.properties, add a suitable list, in the format:

            <NAME OF ARRAY> = 1,2,3,4,5...

        2. In TestAlgorithms.java, call the method to test sorting the structure:

            sort(m , s, "<NAME OF ARRAY>");
